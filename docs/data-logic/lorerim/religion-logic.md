Wintersun is QUST driven
WSN_TrackerQuest_Quest

So we will need to parse Quests, including properties of quests
the named quest hold a great deal of properties with 55 values, these will map to the religions,
Prefixed WSN\_

- Blessing
- Tenet
- Boon1
- Boon2
- DietyName
- DivineType
- FavoredRace0
- FavoredRace1

Ultimately we will be merging to SPEL and MGEFs, looking at DNAMs on MGEFS for descriptions
These include a function of favor, we will hold of on that for now.
