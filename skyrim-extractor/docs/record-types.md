## üîç Filtering Tip

To isolate chore-level records in tools like xEdit:

```regex
PERK|MGEF|SPEL|LVLI|RACE|CLAS|FACT|AVIF|PACK|CSTY|GLOB|FLST
```

This captures core systemic gameplay data excluding art/audio/model content.

## ‚úÖ Use Cases

- **Character creation interface tools**
- **Exporting perks, spells, and leveling data** for analysis
- **Building gameplay analyzers** or balance tools
- **Understanding progression trees** and class mechanics

---

For plugin developers, understanding these records is essential for adjusting balance, progression, or AI behavior without touching visuals or assets.
